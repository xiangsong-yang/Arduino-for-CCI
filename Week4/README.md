# This is the portfolio for Xiangsong Yang's Arduino work in CCI.

## Labs for week4

In week4, Xiangsong went through the 5 labs for better understing using arduino. 

### Lab1- Project proposal
#### Final project 

### Lab2- Hook up a servo

This is the session for using the Arduino to control a servo motor. Based on the information from the tutorial, the servo works with PWM in digital output pins.

Student had succeed making the control of servo by controlling both the angle of the servo and the time of running. They are two different ways of controlling the motor, and different goals can be achieved by mixed use of both principles.
