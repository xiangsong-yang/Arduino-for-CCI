# This is the portfolio for Xiangsong Yang's Arduino work in CCI.

## Labs for week6

In week6, Xiangsong finished the Lab of building up a analogy synth circuit and the learnign about the capacitor.

### Capacitor
In this week, the topics are about capacitors and oscillators.

Capacitor is the component that can store the electronic current for later use as Pheonix explained, which is constructed from two conductive plates wich unconductive material in between. The unit of capacitor is farads, F. The conmmon used scales are pF, nF and uF. 

Capacitors charge by the power applied, and it will generate current. The current it generate will only be relative about the speed of changing voltage,which means if the voltage doesn't change, the current generate by the capacitor will be zero. 

Capacitors can be used widely, from flashing in a camera to the motherboard in a PC. 

### Lab1- Simple synths

The lab is about making a synth with oscillator, capacitors and resistors.

The circuit diagram is shown below.

The method of control is to change frequence(pitch) and wave range(loudness) by changing the capacity and resistance in the circuit.

The process of finishing the lab is not smooth as students expected. The circuit seemed never worked because of some reason that can not be figured out. The lab group tried to debug with multimeter and LED, which is mainly check the shotcut and cables connection.

After working with Pheonix and other group, students had solved the problem which is the wrong chip choice and the circuit had worked as expected.

The outcome is quite exciting for studetns. The lab is playful for studetns. In the video, studetns changed the frequence/pitch of the sound by using a variable resistor changed by the light.

Students also tried to apply two oscillators at the same time, but did not succe. The possible reason for the failure can be the wrong coonecting for the components.
