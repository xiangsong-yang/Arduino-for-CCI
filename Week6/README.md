# This is the portfolio for Xiangsong Yang's Arduino work in CCI.

## Labs for week6

In week6, Xiangsong finished the Lab of building up a analogy synth circuit and the learnign about the capacitor.

### Capacitor
In this week, the topics are about capacitors and oscillators.

Capacitor is the component that can store the electronic current for later use as Pheonix explained, which is constructed from two conductive plates wich unconductive material in between. The unit of capacitor is farads, F. The conmmon used scales are pF, nF and uF. 

Capacitors charge by the power applied, and it will generate current. The current it generate will only be relative about the speed of changing voltage,which means if the voltage doesn't change, the current generate by the capacitor will be zero. 

Capacitors can be used widely, from flashing in a camera to the motherboard in a PC. 

### Lab1- Simple synths
The lab is about making a synth with oscillator, capacitors and resistors.

The circuit diagram is shown below.

The method of control is to change frequence(pitch) and wave range(loudness) by changing the capacity and resistance in the circuit.
### Lab2- Hook up a servo

This is the session for using the Arduino to control a servo motor. Based on the information from the tutorial, the servo works with PWM in digital output pins.

Student had succeed making the control of servo by controlling both the angle of the servo and the time of running. They are two different ways of controlling the motor, and different goals can be achieved by mixed use of both principles.

### Lab3- Hook up a motor
Based on the circuit and example on the ARduino project book which was shared by Pheonix in Week1, student had finished the lab for making controlling with the button and transister.

This circuit was hard for students to achieve the goal. The tricky bit of this lab is mainly wiring and the conponents placement. By testing the circuit for a long time, student had developed the skill of checking the conductivity of cables and connection. It is critical for students to understand the priciples to check the circuit by themselves rather than asking for help from Pheonix.

The use of transisters is the main point to do this lab. Students had understood the using of the transister in the circuit of controlling motor and how to avoid damaging to the power and conponents.


### Lab4 - Hook up an MPR121
This is the lab for studnet to use a touch sensor. In the tutorial, students need to install the library to run the sketch. It is the very first time for Anna to run a library in Arduino IDE. It took time for her to understand how to do it and how to load it.

Another challenging part of this lab is the wiring. It is quite easy to get wrong connection on the board. It is essentialt for student to check the problem and students realised the fact that pins on Arduino is different from the diagram showed in the tutorial.

At the end, after finished the connection with the help from Pheonix. Student had achieved the goal of using the Touch sensor.
