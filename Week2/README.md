# This is the portfolio for Xiangsong Yang's Arduino work in CCI.

## Labs for week2

In week2, Xiangsong had finished the 5 labs, which is mainly about testing with sensors.

The detail of the labs will be explained below.

### Lab00-Leds in Serial and Parallel
From what Xiangsong understood, this lab is about founding the relationship about resistance, voltage and current in serial and parallel circuits.

In serial circuit, every component is connect in serial, which means the they share the same amont of current. 

In parallel circuit, every component is connect in parallel, every component has the same voltage applied on each side.

From the equation, the U = IR, the component's resistance, volate or current can be caculated by given two of them.

In parallel circuit, every component is connect in parallel, every component has the same voltage applied on each side. For components like LEDs, Resistors, the relationship of resistance in total and each components can be caculated as 
R total = r1 + r2 + r3 + ...

In parallel circuit, every component is connect in parallel, every component has the same voltage applied on each side.For LEDs and Resistors, the relationship of resistance in total and each components can be caculated as 
1/R total = 1/r1 + 1/r2 + 1/r3 +...

In these question, the meanning of the runnning out of voltage should be not enough current to power the LED.

#### Question 1: How many leds can you hook up with a 220k resistor in serial before running out of voltage?
For question 1, everything connect in serial, this process can be seen as making a huge resistor.

From the equation, R total = r1 + r2 +r3+...

In ideal situation, the I total = U/ Rtotal

The minimum current to power the led can be worked out by testing with arduino and multimemter.

the number of LEDs n, in the equation and solve the equation, it should be:

n = (5-220k * I)/ I * r LED  (I means minimal current to power LED)

In the real testing with arduino, the number of LED is 3 in total.

#### Question 2: How many leds can you hook up with a 220k resistor in parallel before running out of voltage?
From the equation, 1/R total = 1/r1 + 1/r2 + 1/r3 +... in parallel circuit

From Xiangsong's understanding, the 220k resistor should be connect in serial with the LEDS as shown below. The caculation in theory shows the result of possible number n. In the same condition of current of using 3 LEDs in serial, which has the current of 0.015 mA and led resistance as 110k the number n would be around 220.
