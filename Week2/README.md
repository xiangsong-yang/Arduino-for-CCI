# This is the portfolio for Xiangsong Yang's Arduino work in CCI.

## Labs for week2

In week2, Xiangsong had finished the 5 labs, which is mainly about testing with sensors.

The detail of the labs will be explained below.

### Lab00-Leds in Serial and Parallel
From what Xiangsong understood, this lab is about founding the relationship about resistance, voltage and current in serial and parallel circuits.

In serial circuit, every component is connect in serial, which means the they share the same amont of current. 

In parallel circuit, every component is connect in parallel, every component has the same voltage applied on each side.

From the equation, the U = IR, the component's resistance, volate or current can be caculated by given two of them.

In parallel circuit, every component is connect in parallel, every component has the same voltage applied on each side. For components like LEDs, Resistors, the relationship of resistance in total and each components can be caculated as R total = r1 + r2 + r3 + ...

In parallel circuit, every component is connect in parallel, every component has the same voltage applied on each side.For LEDs and Resistors, the relationship of resistance in total and each components can be caculated as 1/R total = 1/r1 + 1/r2 + 1/r3 +...


#### Question 1: How many leds can you hook up with a 220k resistor in serial before running out of voltage?
For question 1, everything connect in serial, this process can be seen as making a huge resistor.

From the equation, R total = r1 + r2 +r3+...

## Ideation

OOPS is a game that designed to have competitional and interactive gaming experience with peer. 

The main objective of this game is to compete the speed of smash buttons with another competitor. 

The condition of winning is to have obviously higher speed.

The concept of the game

## The making process

The game is based on Arduino and progammed in Arduino IDE.

Xiangsong used breadboard and pin cables to make prototype and test.
